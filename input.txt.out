PARSING...

Alphabet:
	"0"
	"1"
	
States:
	a -- Start vertex -- Terminal vertex -- Common vertex
	b -- Terminal vertex -- Common vertex
	
Transitions: 
	transition between state "a" and "b"  by symbols: ['0', '1']
	transition between state "b" and "a"  by symbols: ['0', '1']
	
==================================

TESTING...

Passed: starting vertex exists
Passed: all states are unique
Passed: all symbols are unique
Passed: automaton is deterministic
Passed: automaton is complete

All checks passed(5/5)!
